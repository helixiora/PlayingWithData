# Playing With Data

Helixiora is a data engineering company, and in our spare time, we do analyse data from all kinds of industries. This is just a bit of play, with interesting insights as we convert data to information, so consider this our "ear on the market". 

Note everything here is raw, charts may be used for marketing purposes, and so on. Just for fun, we don't spend copious amounts of time on keeping things too much in check here. It is a playground.
